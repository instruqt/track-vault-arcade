  title: Unseal
  teaser: Initialize Vault and unseal Vault
  assignment: |-
    Vault is running on http://localhost:8200.
    Initialize it with *1 key share* and a *threshold of 1*.

    Then unseal it and log in with the *root token*.

      Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets.

      A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.
  - type: text
    contents: When a Vault server is started, it starts in a [sealed state](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/seal.html).
      In this state, Vault is configured to know where and how to access the physical
      storage, but doesn't know how to decrypt any of it.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      When the Vault is initialized it generates an encryption key which is used to protect all the data. That key is protected by a master key.

      By default Vault [splits the master key into 5 shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing), and sets a threshold of any 3 of those that are required to reconstruct the master key and unseal the Vault.
  - type: text
    contents: During [initialization](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/operator/init.html)
      the number of key shares and the unseal threshold can be specified.

  title: Write a secret
  teaser: Write a secret to Vault
  assignment: |-
    Write a secret to Vault on the path *secret/highscore*.

    The secret should contain *user=mrrobot* and *score=10000*.

      The [write](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/write.html) command writes data to Vault at the given path.

      The data can be credentials, secrets, configuration, or arbitrary data. The specific behavior of this command is determined at the thing mounted at the given path.

      The [read](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/read.html) command reads data from Vault at the given path.

      This can be used to read secrets, generate dynamic credentials, get configuration details, and more.

  teaser: Enable a secrets backend
  assignment: |-
    Enable the database secrets backend.
    Then configure *database/config/postgres* so it uses connection_url *postgresql://{{username}}:{{password}}@postgres:5432/?sslmode=disable*, *allowed_roles=postgres*, *username=postgres*, *password=notsecure* and the *plugin_name=postgresql-database-plugin*.

      Secrets engines are components which store, generate, or encrypt data.

      Secrets engines are incredibly flexible, so it is easiest to think about them in terms of their function. Secrets engines are provided some set of data, they take some action on that data, and they return a result.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Some secrets engines simply store and read data - like encrypted Redis/Memcached.

      Other secrets engines connect to other services and generate dynamic credentials on demand.

      And even other secrets engines provide encryption as a service, totp generation, certificates, and much more.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Secrets engines are enabled at a "path" in Vault.

      Each secrets engine defines its own paths and properties. To the user, secrets engines behave similar to a virtual filesystem. Just like normal secrets they support operations like read, write, and delete.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The [database secrets engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/databases/index.html) generates database credentials dynamically based on configured roles.

      It works
      with a number of [different databases](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/databases/postgresql.html) through a plugin interface.

  title: Generate dynamic credentials
  teaser: Generate dynamic postgres credentials
  assignment: |-
    Configure *database/roles/postgres* so that it can create database credentials with the following SQL statements.

    CREATE ROLE \"{{name}}\" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '{{password}}' VALID UNTIL '{{expiration}}';
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO \"{{name}}\";

    You can test the configuration by reading from the *database/creds/postgres* endpoint.
  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: For Vault to be able to generate database credentials, a [role](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/databases/index.html#create-role)
      needs to be configured.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Roles use SQL [statements](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/databases/postgresql.html#statements) to create, revoke, rollback and/or renew credentials.

      Roles can be created by writing to the `database/roles/<role-name>` path.

  teaser: Configure Vault as TOTP provider
  assignment: |-
    Enable the TOTP secrets engine and configure Vault to be a *TOTP provider* on the path *totp/keys/mrrobot*.

    The issuer should be *Vault* and the account_name should be *mrrobot@instruqt.com*.

    You can test the configuration by reading from the *totp/code/mrrobot* endpoint.
  notes:

      Another secrets engine in Vault is the [TOTP generator](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/totp/index.html).

      The TOTP secrets engine generates time-based credentials according to the TOTP standard.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The TOTP secrets engine can act as a TOTP code [generator](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/totp/index.html#as-a-generator).

      In this mode, it can replace traditional TOTP generators like Google Authenticator. It provides an added layer of security since the ability to generate codes is guarded by policies and the entire process is audited.
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      The TOTP secrets engine can also act as a TOTP [provider](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/totp/index.html#as-a-provider).

      In this mode, it can be used to generate new keys and validate passwords generated using those keys.
